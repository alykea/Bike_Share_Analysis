This dataset is from [divvy](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It has been made publicly available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

This dataset was originally cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using R Programming Language in RStudio.

Find my code in R [here](https://github.com/alykea/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/bike_share_analysis.rmd).

Find the preview in [Markdown](https://github.com/alykea/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/bike_share_analysis.md).

Here is the [PowerPoint Presentation](https://github.com/alykea/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/bike_share_analysis_files/Bike_Share_Analysis.pdf).

For fun, I also visualized in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/shared/RJMNKJR9D?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). I had to run a slightly different code in RStudio, which you can find [here](https://github.com/alykea/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/R_code_for_Tableau).

Please enjoy.
